# Performance

The PDF Reader MCP Server is designed to be performant for standard PDF processing tasks. Initial benchmarks show that the server can handle various operations efficiently, with response times typically under 1 second for most operations.

## Performance Considerations

The server is considered performant for standard PDF documents. However, performance can vary depending on:

- **PDF Complexity:** Documents with many pages, complex graphics, large embedded fonts, or non-standard structures may take longer to parse.
- **Network Latency:** When processing PDFs from URLs, network speed and latency will affect performance.
- **File Size:** Larger PDF files require more processing time.

## Asynchronous Operations

All potentially long-running operations, including network requests (for URL PDFs), and PDF parsing itself, are handled asynchronously using `async/await`. This prevents the server from blocking the Node.js event loop and allows it to handle multiple requests efficiently.

## Performance Benchmarks

Initial benchmarks using Vitest on a sample PDF show efficient handling of various operations:

| Scenario                         | Operations per Second (hz) | Relative Speed |
| :------------------------------- | :------------------------- | :------------- |
| Handle Non-Existent URL          | ~12,933                    | Fastest        |
| Get Full Text                    | ~5,575                     |                |
| Get Specific Page (Page 1)       | ~5,329                     |                |
| Get Specific Pages (Pages 1 & 2) | ~5,242                     |                |
| Get Metadata & Page Count        | ~4,912                     | Slowest        |

_(Higher hz indicates better performance. Results may vary based on PDF complexity and environment.)_

## Future Performance Improvements

- **Caching:** Implement caching for frequently accessed PDFs.
- **Streaming:** Consider streaming PDF processing for very large files.
- **Parallel Processing:** Explore parallel processing for multiple PDF sources.
- **Network Optimization:** Optimize network requests for URL-based PDFs.
