# Performance Documentation

Performance is an important consideration for the PDF Reader MCP Server, especially when dealing with large or complex PDF documents. This page outlines the benchmarking approach and presents results from initial tests.

## Benchmarking Approach

We use Vitest's built-in benchmarking capabilities to measure performance across different PDF processing scenarios. The benchmarks focus on:

- **Test Environment:** Node.js environment with controlled conditions.
- **Test File:** A sample PDF located at `test/fixtures/sample.pdf`. The exact characteristics of this file (size, page count, complexity) will influence the results.
- **Metrics:** Operations per second (hz) to measure throughput.

## Benchmark Results

Initial benchmarks using Vitest on a sample PDF show efficient handling of various operations:

| Scenario                         | Operations per Second (hz) | Relative Speed |
| :------------------------------- | :------------------------- | :------------- |
| Handle Non-Existent URL          | ~12,933                    | Fastest        |
| Get Full Text                    | ~5,575                     |                |
| Get Specific Page (Page 1)       | ~5,329                     |                |
| Get Specific Pages (Pages 1 & 2) | ~5,242                     |                |
| Get Metadata & Page Count        | ~4,912                     | Slowest        |

## Performance Analysis

- Handling errors for non-existent URLs is the fastest operation as it involves minimal I/O and no PDF parsing.
- Full text extraction and specific page extraction show similar performance for this file.
- Extracting only metadata and page count was slightly slower than full text extraction for this file.

**Note:** These results are specific to the `sample.pdf` file and the testing environment used. Performance with different PDFs (varying sizes, complexities, versions, or structures) may differ significantly.

## Future Benchmarking Plans

- **Diverse PDF Types:** Test with PDFs of varying sizes, complexities, and structures.
- **Network Performance:** Measure performance impact of network latency for URL-based PDFs.
- **Memory Usage:** Monitor memory consumption during PDF processing.
- **Concurrent Processing:** Test performance with multiple simultaneous requests.

## Running Benchmarks

To run the benchmarks locally:

```bash
npm run test:bench
```

This will execute the benchmark tests and provide detailed performance metrics.
